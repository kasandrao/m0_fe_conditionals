# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
- I feel about 4/5.
3. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
- These were easy enough to understand in class but it was really difficult to complete the CFU assignment. I felt I kept running into issues when typing in the code.
5. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
- About the same as with the logical operators. Learning was a lot easier than doing it. 
7. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
- I thought I'd be done within an hour but it's taken me about 2 hours. 
9. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
- I definitely want to review the whole lesson. I will try to review in the morning when I prepare for session 4
11. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
- I have been running into issues with typing out the code. I will try to get screenshots for the class channel to see if anyone else has had that happen and what I need to do to fix it.
